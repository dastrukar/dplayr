# dPlayR

A minimalist Classic Doom(TM) launcher, and a *hopefully* better version of dPlay.
Written in Rust.

All parameters can be set through a config file generated on first run.

## Why?
I made dPlayR as an excuse to learn Rust.

I was also annoyed with how dPlay didn't have the option to make presets, which made changing parameters a chore.

Oh, and I guess I also hate trying compile a Python program. *heh*

## What's new?
* Custom variables!
* Presets!
* Better comments! (well kind of)

## Wiki
You should probably read the wiki. Or you might get lost on how to do certain things.
